### Blog for travelers where you can post places you've visited, change information about yourself, and put likes.

In this project, I've:
* built the website based on a design layout in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2cn9N9jSkmxD84oJik7xL7/JavaScript.-Sprint-4?node-id=0%3A1),
* checked the accuracy of the layout in Pixel Perfect, 
* used FlexBox and Grid to place blocks on the page,
* made the page adaptive for different devices from mobile to large screens, 
* used the BEM methodology working with tags and the file structure.

Using native JavaScript, I've:
* added profile editing and avatar changing functionality,
* made pop-ups opening when pressing the button and closing when clicking ESC or background,
* added the functionality of putting and removing likes on cards,
* added functionality to add and delete only the card that was added by the user,
* made API requests to the server,
* added form validation.

I've also learned how to:
* use OOP when working on a project,
* split the JS code into modules and use export/import,
* build a project with Webpack,
* deploy the project to the server.

## Installation
* Run `GitBash` (or `Terminal` on MacOS);
* Select or create a new repository where you want to put the project;
* Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/IrinaSfv/mesto.git`;
* Run `cd mesto`;
* Run `npm i webpack --save-dev`;
* Run `npm run build`;
* Run `npm run dev`.
